## Note
- If you are reading this then you are here too soon
- WIP - MVP coming soon
- The euclidean class is quite intelligeble and ready to use

## Checklist

- [x] master clock
- [ ] rotate sequences
- [ ] Two Euclidean sequence output gates 
- [ ] An extra gate output that sequentially outputs each sequences
- [ ] Tap tempo
